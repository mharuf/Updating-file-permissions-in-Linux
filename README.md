<h1>Updating file permissions in Linux</h1>
As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate programme I was given the opportunity to learn and practise using the Linux command line interface. I was taught the basics of reading files and navigating through directories before being given fictional scenarios by the programme to change permissions. The attached file demonstrates how I navigated through directories in Linux and changed access permissions for certain files and directories to only allow authorised personnel access. This was an exciting experience as I was accustomed to using a graphical user interface in my everyday life, so using a command line interface to complete tasks was very interesting.
